# Array Concept Review Lab

## Learning Goals

- Perform operations on arrays

## Introduction

Let's practice array operations. As you practice, consider the use of methods
that were built into the `Enumerable` and `Array` classes. Knowing built-in Ruby
libraries saves time and prevents bugs.

## Perform Operations on Arrays

### `#using_max`

Define a method that finds the highest number in a given array.

### `#find_nth_element`

Define a method that finds Nemo in a nested array.

### `#flatten_nested_arrays`

Define a method that flattens a nested array.

### `#flatten_then_sort`

Define a method that flattens the nested array, and then returns the previous
array sorted alphabetically.

## Conclusion

There are several methods built into Ruby libraries that help you work with data
in arrays. By using these, you will avoid errors and make your code as clear as
possible.
