# Array Concept Review Lab

## Learning Goals

- Perform operations on arrays

## Introduction

Let's practice array operations. Consider the use of methods that were built-in
to the `Enumerable` and `Array` classes. Knowing built-in Ruby libraries save
time and prevents bugs. By using these, you will prevent errors and ensure that
your code is as clear as possible.

## Perform operations on Arrays as guided by tests

### `#using_max`

Define a method that finds the highest number in a given array.

### `#find_nth_element`

Define a method that finds Nemo in a nested array.

### `#flatten_nested_arrays`

Define a method that flattens a nested array.

### `#flatten_then_sort`

Define a method that flattens the nested array, and then returns the previous
array sorted alphabetically.

## Conclusion

There are many varied and fun ways that you can manipulate arrays to make data
work for you. As long as you focus on working with the built in methods first,
the sky's the limit!
